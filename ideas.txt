🔝 Best UX Improvements for NW-Builds

1. Homepage First Impression
Current: Oversized hero with little actionable content.
Fix: Redesign above-the-fold:
Clear value proposition (“Find the best New World builds & tools in seconds”).
Direct CTAs: Search bar, Top Builds, Skill Builder.
Visual build cards instead of plain text links.
Why: First 5 seconds decide if a user stays or bounces. Right now, too much scrolling is needed.

2. Navigation Simplification
Current: Builds page has both side nav + filter bar → redundant.
Fix: Consolidate into one navigation method. Keep filter chips (mobile-friendly) and drop/demote side nav.
Why: Cognitive load decreases. One clear way to browse improves task completion.

3. Build Cards & Visual Hierarchy
Current: Builds often appear as text lists.
Fix: Use visual cards with:
Weapon icons, role tags (PvP, PvE, Tank, Healer).
“Updated for Patch X.X” freshness tag.
Why: Improves scannability, trust, and encourages clicks.

4. Skill Builder Usability
Current: Reset button + point counter float awkwardly.
Fix: Add a sticky bottom bar with key actions (points spent, reset, export, save).
Why: Familiar pattern in gaming tools, reduces confusion, boosts engagement.

5. Information Architecture
Current: Homepage buries builds, guides, and tools equally far down.
Fix: Reorganize content into three clear pillars:
Builds (default CTA for new visitors).
Guides (supporting content).
Tools (interactive calculators).
Why: Clarifies the site’s structure and reduces hunting.

6. Trust & Authority
Current: Builds lack timestamps, author presence.
Fix: Add last updated date, patch version, and author credit.
Why: Gaming metas change fast; freshness = credibility. This reduces bounce.

7. Personalization & Retention
Current: Every visit feels the same.
Fix: Add recently viewed builds and favorites (stored locally, no login needed).
Why: Keeps people returning and reduces friction when revisiting.

8. Community & Social Proof
Current: Feels like a solo utility site
Fix: Add “Most popular builds this week” or basic voting/like system.
Why: Social proof builds trust, keeps content dynamic.

9. Performance & Mobile Optimization
Current: Vite + React stack is good, but bundle is heavy (~53 deps).
Fix: Audit bundle size, lazy-load routes, prioritize mobile layout (especially builder).
Why: Gamers often browse builds on mobile while playing. Performance directly impacts conversion.

10. Conversion Layer (Soft + Twitch)
Current: Twitch presence is absent.
Fix: Add non-intrusive Twitch CTAs:
In homepage hero (“Live on Twitch”).
At end of builds/guides (“See this in action on Twitch”).
Small persistent “Live Now” badge.
Why: Integrates Twitch as part of the experience without overwhelming the rest.

🎯 Priority Roadmap

Homepage redesign (value prop + builds upfront).
Simplify navigation (one clear filter).
Improve build presentation (cards + freshness tags).
Fix skill builder UX (sticky bar).
Layer trust signals (updates, authorship).
Add light personalization (favorites/recently viewed).
Introduce community/social proof.
Optimize mobile & performance.
Then: Layer soft Twitch CTAs naturally.

























1. Hero Section = “Live Hook”
Current issue: The hero is large but static, not driving any action.
Change: Replace with a Twitch-focused hero:
Embed “Live Now on Twitch” widget if you’re streaming.
If offline, show next scheduled stream or best highlight clip.
Add a Watch on Twitch CTA button (large, above the fold).
Reason: Every visitor sees this first. Right now, it’s wasted space. Make Twitch the centerpiece.


2. Build Pages → Soft Funnel to Twitch
Current issue: Build pages deliver value, but no connection to you.
Change: Add a small Twitch banner or CTA inside each build:
“Want to see this build in action? Watch live on Twitch.”
Could be a sticky sidebar block or a CTA at the end of each build.
Reason: Users consuming builds are highly qualified leads for your Twitch — they’re interested in gameplay, not just theory.


3. Persistent Twitch CTA (Non-Intrusive)
Current issue: No constant Twitch presence.
Change: Add a floating Twitch bar/badge (bottom-right corner):
Shows Live indicator when you’re live.
Expands on hover to “Watch Now.”
Reason: Constant reminder without breaking UX flow. Users can ignore if they want, but it’s always there.


4. Homepage Content Blocks → Stream-Focused
Current issue: Homepage hides value below fold.
Change:
Add a “From My Stream” section → short clips of you testing builds, boss fights, PvP duels.
Add “This week on Twitch” → highlight reel or schedule.
Reason: Creates curiosity and humanizes the site. Visitors don’t just see tools; they see you as the expert.


5. Social Proof & Trust
Current issue: Feels like a standalone tool, no authority reinforcement.
Change:
Add Twitch follower count / live viewer count if strong.
Testimonials or “Featured on Reddit / Discord” tags if applicable.
Reason: Social proof pushes users from passive browsing → active following.







Build Finder (like a wizard to help people find a build for what they are looking for, still no idea how this should look like)

Personalization: like having "recently viewed builds" or something, to get rid of monotony

long term, some voting system for builds (that I was about to talk to LLANGI first)

Give some context about LLANGI, because usually in build websites, credibility is the key, so having some data about llangi and his 10k hours in game, might help building trust?
  
Reorganize the home page into more priotity into the 3 main things inside website: Reorganize into 3 pillars: Builds → Guides → Tools

I was thinking to get the overwall website more New World vibe, probably using tied fonts, iconograph, etc...
